This is a learning project I started when I began learning Python. It's a simple file encryption and decryption tool that allows users to secure their files using the Fernet encryption method.

## Features

- Encrypt files to keep them secure.
- Decrypt previously encrypted files.
- Navigate through directories for file selection.
- Generates and saves encryption keys.
- User-friendly command-line interface.

## Installation

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip in the  [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Briankimany/enrypter_decrypter/blob/main/requirements.txt)


bash


## Usage

To encrypt a file, use the following command:

python main.py
